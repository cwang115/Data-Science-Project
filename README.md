INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE

Case Study 1: Collecting Data from Twitter
We used Twitter Streaming API to collect data regarding "Ryanair" and performed Data Analysis for analyzing the tweets and tweet entities with frequency analysis and also performed Sentimental Analysis.

Case Study 2: Analyzing Data from MovieLens
We used 1 million dataset from MovieLens and performed Data Analysis to provide a possible solution of how a movie company could promote the movie according to genre, age group, occupation and gender.

Case Study 3: Textual analysis of movie reviews
We used polarity dataset v2.0, which consists of 2000 .txt files, each containing a movie review, out of which 1000 positive and 1000 negative processed reviews are available. We followed standard sentimental analysis procedure of scikit-learn and explored TfidVectorizer class. We worked on few Machine Learning algorithms where we examined two classifiers LinearSVC and KneighborsClassfiers. Then we performed dimensionality reduction using various methods and also explored manifold learning algorithms to seperate positive and negative reviews.

Case Stsudy 4: Yelp recommender system
We used the datasets that we collected from Yelpâ€™s Dataset Challenge. Yelp provided us with five different datasets which includes business, check-in, review, tip, photos and user. In this project we performed three recommendations: Top restaurant recommendation in an area using clustering, recommend potential friends to users based on similarity metrics and second level relationship respectively and Recommending potential users to business owners using Collaborative filtering.
