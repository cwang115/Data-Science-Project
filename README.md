# Data-Science-Project
This is the repository for course projects of DS501: Introduction to Data Science
We used Twitter Streaming API to collect data regarding "Ryanair" and performed Data Analysis for analyzing the tweets and tweet entities with frequency analysis and also performed Sentimental Analysis using Python.

Analyzed Data from MovieLens to provide a possible solution of how a movie company could promote the movie according to genre, age group, occupation and gender using Python.

Textual analysis of movie reviews by performing sentimental analysis procedure of scikit-learn and explored TfidVectorizer class. 

Incorporated Machine Learning algorithms and examined two classifiers LinearSVC and KneighborsClassfiers. 

Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA, SelectKBest, Truncated SVD, Kernel PCA and Incremental PCA.

Explored manifold learning algorithms, few of them are LLE, MDS, TSNE, Isomap, Spectral Embedding to seperate positive and negative reviews using Python.
